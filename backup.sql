In standard SQL, they are not\nequivalent.

This includes any\ndefault value implied for these options by the setting of the\nInitialLogFileGroup data node configuration parameter.\n\nThe maximum permitted for UNDO_BUFFER_SIZE is 629145600 (600 MB).\n\nOn 32-bit systems, the maximum supported value for INITIAL_SIZE is\n4294967296 (4 GB). (Bug #29186)\n\nThe minimum allowed value for INITIAL_SIZE is 1048576 (1 MB).\n\nThe ENGINE option determines the storage engine to be used by this log\nfile group, with engine_name being the name of the storage engine. In\nMySQL 5.5, this must be NDB (or NDBCLUSTER). If ENGINE is not set,\nMySQL tries to use the engine specified by the default_storage_engine\nserver system variable (formerly storage_engine). In any case, if the\nengine is not specified as NDB or NDBCLUSTER, the CREATE LOGFILE GROUP\nstatement appears to succeed but actually fails to create the log file\ngroup, as shown here:\n\nmysql> CREATE LOGFILE GROUP lg1 \n    ->     ADD UNDOFILE \'undo.dat\' INITIAL_SIZE = 10M;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SHOW WARNINGS;\n+-------+------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Level | Code | Message                                                                                        |\n+-------+------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Error | 1478 | Table storage engine \'InnoDB\' does not support the create option \'TABLESPACE or LOGFILE GROUP\' |\n+-------+------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> DROP LOGFILE GROUP lg1 ENGINE = NDB;              \nERROR 1529 (HY000): Failed to drop LOGFILE GROUP\n\nmysql> CREATE LOGFILE GROUP lg1 \n    ->     ADD UNDOFILE \'undo.dat\' INITIAL_SIZE = 10M\n    ->     ENGINE = NDB;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (2.97 sec)\n\nThe fact that the CREATE LOGFILE GROUP statement does not actually\nreturn an error when a non-NDB storage engine is named, but rather\nappears to succeed, is a known issue which we hope to address in a\nfuture release of MySQL Cluster.\n\nREDO_BUFFER_SIZE, NODEGROUP, WAIT, and COMMENT are parsed but ignored,\nand so have no effect in MySQL 5.5. These options are intended for\nfuture expansion.\n\nWhen used with ENGINE [=] NDB, a log file group and associated UNDO log\nfile are created on each Cluster data node. You can verify that the\nUNDO files were created and obtain information about them by querying\nthe INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES table. For example:\n\nmysql> SELECT LOGFILE_GROUP_NAME, LOGFILE_GROUP_NUMBER, EXTRA\n    -> FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES\n    -> WHERE FILE_NAME = \'undo_10.dat\';\n+--------------------+----------------------+----------------+\n| LOGFILE_GROUP_NAME | LOGFILE_GROUP_NUMBER | EXTRA          |\n+--------------------+----------------------+----------------+\n| lg_3               |                   11 | CLUSTER_NODE=3 |\n| lg_3               |                   11 | CLUSTER_NODE=4 |\n+--------------------+----------------------+----------------+\n2 rows in set (0.06 sec)\n\nCREATE LOGFILE GROUP is useful only with Disk Data storage for MySQL\nCluster.

The\nWHERE clause, if given, specifies the conditions that identify which\nrows to delete. With no WHERE clause, all rows are deleted. If the\nORDER BY clause is specified, the rows are deleted in the order that is\nspecified. The LIMIT clause places a limit on the number of rows that\ncan be deleted.\n\nFor the multiple-table syntax, DELETE deletes from each tbl_name the\nrows that satisfy the conditions. In this case, ORDER BY and LIMIT\ncannot be used.\n\nwhere_condition is an expression that evaluates to true for each row to\nbe deleted. It is specified as described in\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/select.html.\n\nCurrently, you cannot delete from a table and select from the same\ntable in a subquery.\n\nYou need the DELETE privilege on a table to delete rows from it.

An error occurs\nfor accounts that already exist. To use this statement, you must have\nthe global CREATE USER privilege or the INSERT privilege for the mysql\ndatabase. For each account, CREATE USER creates a new row in the\nmysql.user table with no privileges and (as of MySQL 5.5.7) assigns the\naccount an authentication plugin. Depending on the syntax used, CREATE\nUSER may also assign the account a password.\n\nEach user_specification clause consists of an account name and\ninformation about how authentication occurs for clients that use the\naccount.

For example:\n\nCREATE USER \'jeffrey\'@\'localhost\' IDENTIFIED BY \'mypass\';\n\nIf you specify only the user name part of the account name, a host name\npart of \'%\' is used.\n\nThe server assigns an authentication plugin and password to each\naccount as follows, depending on whether the user specification clause\nincludes IDENTIFIED WITH to specify a plugin or IDENTIFIED BY to\nspecify a password:\n\n*Note*: IDENTIFIED WITH is available as of MySQL 5.5.7. Before 5.5.7,\nauthentication plugins are not used, so only the remarks about\nIDENTIFIED BY apply.\n\no With IDENTIFIED WITH, the server assigns the specified plugin and the\n  account has no password.\n\no With IDENTIFIED BY, the server assigns no plugin and assigns the\n  specified password.\n\no With neither IDENTIFIED WITH nor IDENTIFIED BY, the server assigns no\n  plugin and the account has no password.\n\nIf the account has no password, the Password column in the account\'s\nmysql.user table row remains empty, which is insecure. To set the\npassword, use SET PASSWORD. See [HELP SET PASSWORD].\n\nIf the server assigns no plugin to the account, the plugin column in\nthe account\'s mysql.user table row remains empty.\n\nFor client connections that use a given account, the server invokes the\nauthentication plugin assigned to the account and the client must\nprovide credentials as required by the authentication method that the\nplugin implements. If the server cannot find the plugin, either at\naccount-creation time or connect time, an error occurs.\n\nIf an account\'s mysql.user table row has a nonempty plugin column:\n\no The server authenticates client connection attempts using the named\n  plugin.\n\no Changes to the account password using SET PASSWORD with PASSWORD()\n  must be made with the old_passwords system variable set to the value\n  required by the authentication plugin, so that PASSWORD() uses the\n  appropriate password hashing method. If the plugin is\n  mysql_old_password, the password can also be changed using SET\n  PASSWORD with OLD_PASSWORD(), which uses pre-4.1 password hashing\n  regardless of the value of old_passwords.\n\nIf an account\'s mysql.user table row has an empty plugin column:\n\no The server authenticates client connection attempts using the\n  mysql_native_password or mysql_old_password authentication plugin,\n  depending on the hash format of the password stored in the Password\n  column.\n\no Changes to the account password using SET PASSWORD can be made with\n  PASSWORD(), with old_passwords set to 0 or 1 for 4.1 or pre-4.1\n  password hashing, respectively, or with OLD_PASSWORD(), which uses\n  pre-4.1 password hashing regardless of the value of old_passwords.\n\nCREATE USER examples:\n\no To specify an authentication plugin for an account, use IDENTIFIED\n  WITH auth_plugin. The plugin name can be a quoted string literal or\n  an unquoted name. \'auth_string\' is an optional quoted string literal\n  to pass to the plugin. The plugin interprets the meaning of the\n  string, so its format is plugin specific. Consult the documentation\n  for a given plugin for information about the authentication string\n  values it accepts, if any.\n\nCREATE USER \'jeffrey\'@\'localhost\' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password;\n\n  The server assigns the given authentication plugin to the account but\n  no password. Clients must provide no password when they connect.\n  However, an account with no password is insecure. To ensure that an\n  account uses a specific authentication plugin and has a password with\n  the corresponding hash format, specify the plugin explicitly with\n  IDENTIFIED WITH, then use SET PASSWORD to set the password:\n\nCREATE USER \'jeffrey\'@\'localhost\' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password;\nSET old_passwords = 0;\nSET PASSWORD FOR \'jeffrey\'@\'localhost\' = PASSWORD(\'mypass\');\n\n  Changes to the account password using SET PASSWORD with PASSWORD()\n  must be made with the old_passwords system variable set to the value\n  required by the account\'s authentication plugin, so that PASSWORD()\n  uses the appropriate password hashing method. Therefore, to use the\n  mysql_old_password plugin instead, name that plugin in the CREATE\n  USER statement and set old_passwords to 1 before using SET PASSWORD.\n\no To specify a password for an account at account-creation time, use\n  IDENTIFIED BY with the literal plaintext password value:\n\nCREATE USER \'jeffrey\'@\'localhost\' IDENTIFIED BY \'mypass\';\n\n  The server assigns the given password to the account but no\n  authentication plugin. Clients must provide the password when they\n  connect.\n\no To avoid specifying the plaintext password if you know its hash value\n  (the value that PASSWORD() would return for the password), specify\n  the hash value preceded by the keyword PASSWORD:\n\nCREATE USER \'jeffrey\'@\'localhost\'\nIDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD \'*90E462C37378CED12064BB3388827D2BA3A9B689\';\n\n  The server assigns the given password to the account but no\n  authentication plugin. Clients must provide the password when they\n  connect.\n\no To enable the user to connect with no password, include no IDENTIFIED\n  BY clause:\n\nCREATE USER \'jeffrey\'@\'localhost\';\n\n  The server assigns no authentication plugin or password to the\n  account. Clients must provide no password when they connect. However,\n  an account with no password is insecure.

This means that as\nsoon as you execute a statement that updates (modifies) a table, MySQL\nstores the update on disk to make it permanent. The change cannot be\nrolled back.\n\nTo disable autocommit mode implicitly for a single series of\nstatements, use the START TRANSACTION statement:\n\nSTART TRANSACTION;\nSELECT @A:=SUM(salary) FROM table1 WHERE type=1;\nUPDATE table2 SET summary=@A WHERE type=1;\nCOMMIT;\n\nWith START TRANSACTION, autocommit remains disabled until you end the\ntransaction with COMMIT or ROLLBACK. The autocommit mode then reverts\nto its previous state.\n\nYou can also begin a transaction like this:\n\nSTART TRANSACTION WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT;\n\nThe WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT option starts a consistent read for\nstorage engines that are capable of it. This applies only to InnoDB.\nThe effect is the same as issuing a START TRANSACTION followed by a\nSELECT from any InnoDB table. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-consistent-read.html. The\nWITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT option does not change the current transaction\nisolation level, so it provides a consistent snapshot only if the\ncurrent isolation level is one that permits a consistent read. The only\nisolation level that permits a consistent read is REPEATABLE READ. For\nall other isolation levels, the WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT clause is\nignored. As of MySQL 5.5.34, a warning is generated when the WITH\nCONSISTENT SNAPSHOT is ignored.\n\n*Important*: Many APIs used for writing MySQL client applications (such\nas JDBC) provide their own methods for starting transactions that can\n(and sometimes should) be used instead of sending a START TRANSACTION\nstatement from the client. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/connectors-apis.html, or the\ndocumentation for your API, for more information.\n\nTo disable autocommit mode explicitly, use the following statement:\n\nSET autocommit=0;\n\nAfter disabling autocommit mode by setting the autocommit variable to\nzero, changes to transaction-safe tables (such as those for InnoDB or\nNDBCLUSTER) are not made permanent immediately. You must use COMMIT to\nstore your changes to disk or ROLLBACK to ignore the changes.\n\nautocommit is a session variable and must be set for each session. To\ndisable autocommit mode for each new connection, see the description of\nthe autocommit system variable at\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/server-system-variables.html.\n\nBEGIN and BEGIN WORK are supported as aliases of START TRANSACTION for\ninitiating a transaction. START TRANSACTION is standard SQL syntax and\nis the recommended way to start an ad-hoc transaction.\n\nThe BEGIN statement differs from the use of the BEGIN keyword that\nstarts a BEGIN ... END compound statement. The latter does not begin a\ntransaction. See [HELP BEGIN END].\n\n*Note*: Within all stored programs (stored procedures and functions,\ntriggers, and events), the parser treats BEGIN [WORK] as the beginning\nof a BEGIN ... END block. Begin a transaction in this context with\nSTART TRANSACTION instead.\n\nThe optional WORK keyword is supported for COMMIT and ROLLBACK, as are\nthe CHAIN and RELEASE clauses. CHAIN and RELEASE can be used for\nadditional control over transaction completion. The value of the\ncompletion_type system variable determines the default completion\nbehavior. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/server-system-variables.html.\n\nThe AND CHAIN clause causes a new transaction to begin as soon as the\ncurrent one ends, and the new transaction has the same isolation level\nas the just-terminated transaction. The RELEASE clause causes the\nserver to disconnect the current client session after terminating the\ncurrent transaction. Including the NO keyword suppresses CHAIN or\nRELEASE completion, which can be useful if the completion_type system\nvariable is set to cause chaining or release completion by default.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/commit.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/commit.html'),(149,'BETWEEN AND',19,'Syntax:\nexpr BETWEEN min AND max\n\nIf expr is greater than or equal to min and expr is less than or equal\nto max, BETWEEN returns 1, otherwise it returns 0.

It also updates the contents of the\nmaster.info and relay-log.info files. To use CHANGE MASTER TO, the\nslave replication threads must be stopped (use STOP SLAVE if\nnecessary).\n\nOptions not specified retain their value, except as indicated in the\nfollowing discussion. Thus, in most cases, there is no need to specify\noptions that do not change. For example, if the password to connect to\nyour MySQL master has changed, you just need to issue these statements\nto tell the slave about the new password:\n\nSTOP SLAVE; -- if replication was running\nCHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_PASSWORD=\'new3cret\';\nSTART SLAVE; -- if you want to restart replication\n\nMASTER_HOST, MASTER_USER, MASTER_PASSWORD, and MASTER_PORT provide\ninformation to the slave about how to connect to its master:\n\no MASTER_HOST and MASTER_PORT are the host name (or IP address) of the\n  master host and its TCP/IP port.\n\n  *Note*: Replication cannot use Unix socket files. You must be able to\n  connect to the master MySQL server using TCP/IP.\n\n  If you specify the MASTER_HOST or MASTER_PORT option, the slave\n  assumes that the master server is different from before (even if the\n  option value is the same as its current value.) In this case, the old\n  values for the master binary log file name and position are\n  considered no longer applicable, so if you do not specify\n  MASTER_LOG_FILE and MASTER_LOG_POS in the statement,\n  MASTER_LOG_FILE=\'\' and MASTER_LOG_POS=4 are silently appended to it.\n\n  Setting MASTER_HOST=\'\' (that is, setting its value explicitly to an\n  empty string) is not the same as not setting MASTER_HOST at all.\n  Beginning with MySQL 5.5, trying to set MASTER_HOST to an empty\n  string fails with an error. Previously, setting MASTER_HOST to an\n  empty string caused START SLAVE subsequently to fail. (Bug #28796)\n\no MASTER_USER and MASTER_PASSWORD are the user name and password of the\n  account to use for connecting to the master.\n\n  In MySQL 5.5.20 and later, MASTER_USER cannot be made empty; setting\n  MASTER_USER = \'\' or leaving it unset when setting a value for\n  MASTER_PASSWORD causes an error (Bug #13427949).\n\n  The password used for a MySQL Replication slave account in a CHANGE\n  MASTER TO statement is limited to 32 characters in length; if the\n  password is longer, the statement succeeds, but any excess characters\n  are silently truncated. This is an issue specific to MySQL\n  Replication, which is fixed in MySQL 5.7. (Bug #11752299, Bug #43439)\n\n  The text of a running CHANGE MASTER TO statement, including values\n  for MASTER_USER and MASTER_PASSWORD, can be seen in the output of a\n  concurrent SHOW PROCESSLIST statement.\n\nThe MASTER_SSL_xxx options provide information about using SSL for the\nconnection. They correspond to the --ssl-xxx options described in\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/ssl-options.html, and\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/replication-solutions-ssl.html.\nThese options can be changed even on slaves that are compiled without\nSSL support. They are saved to the master.info file, but are ignored if\nthe slave does not have SSL support enabled.\n\nMASTER_CONNECT_RETRY specifies how many seconds to wait between connect\nretries. The default is 60. The number of reconnection attempts is\nlimited by the --master-retry-count server option; for more\ninformation, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/replication-options.html.\n\nThe MASTER_BIND option is available in MySQL Cluster NDB 7.2 and later,\nbut is not supported in mainline MySQL 5.5.\n\nMASTER_BIND is for use on replication slaves having multiple network\ninterfaces, and determines which of the slave\'s network interfaces is\nchosen for connecting to the master.\n\nMASTER_HEARTBEAT_PERIOD sets the interval in seconds between\nreplication heartbeats. Whenever the master\'s binary log is updated\nwith an event, the waiting period for the next heartbeat is reset.\ninterval is a decimal value having the range 0 to 4294967 seconds and a\nresolution in milliseconds; the smallest nonzero value is 0.001.\nHeartbeats are sent by the master only if there are no unsent events in\nthe binary log file for a period longer than interval.\n\nSetting interval to 0 disables heartbeats altogether. The default value\nfor interval is equal to the value of slave_net_timeout divided by 2.\n\nSetting @@global.slave_net_timeout to a value less than that of the\ncurrent heartbeat interval results in a warning being issued. The\neffect of issuing RESET SLAVE on the heartbeat interval is to reset it\nto the default value.\n\nMASTER_LOG_FILE and MASTER_LOG_POS are the coordinates at which the\nslave I/O thread should begin reading from the master the next time the\nthread starts. RELAY_LOG_FILE and RELAY_LOG_POS are the coordinates at\nwhich the slave SQL thread should begin reading from the relay log the\nnext time the thread starts. If you specify either of MASTER_LOG_FILE\nor MASTER_LOG_POS, you cannot specify RELAY_LOG_FILE or RELAY_LOG_POS.\nIf neither of MASTER_LOG_FILE or MASTER_LOG_POS is specified, the slave\nuses the last coordinates of the slave SQL thread before CHANGE MASTER\nTO was issued. This ensures that there is no discontinuity in\nreplication, even if the slave SQL thread was late compared to the\nslave I/O thread, when you merely want to change, say, the password to\nuse.\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO deletes all relay log files and starts a new one,\nunless you specify RELAY_LOG_FILE or RELAY_LOG_POS. In that case, relay\nlog files are kept; the relay_log_purge global variable is set silently\nto 0.\n\nPrior to MySQL 5.5, RELAY_LOG_FILE required an absolute path. In MySQL\n5.5, the path can be relative, in which case the path is assumed to be\nrelative to the slave\'s data directory. (Bug #12190)\n\nIGNORE_SERVER_IDS was added in MySQL 5.5. This option takes a\ncomma-separated list of 0 or more server IDs. Events originating from\nthe corresponding servers are ignored, with the exception of log\nrotation and deletion events, which are still recorded in the relay\nlog.\n\nIn circular replication, the originating server normally acts as the\nterminator of its own events, so that they are not applied more than\nonce. Thus, this option is useful in circular replication when one of\nthe servers in the circle is removed. Suppose that you have a circular\nreplication setup with 4 servers, having server IDs 1, 2, 3, and 4, and\nserver 3 fails. When bridging the gap by starting replication from\nserver 2 to server 4, you can include IGNORE_SERVER_IDS = (3) in the\nCHANGE MASTER TO statement that you issue on server 4 to tell it to use\nserver 2 as its master instead of server 3. Doing so causes it to\nignore and not to propagate any statements that originated with the\nserver that is no longer in use.\n\nWhen a CHANGE MASTER TO statement is issued without any\nIGNORE_SERVER_IDS option, any existing list is preserved. To clear the\nlist of ignored servers, it is necessary to use the option with an\nempty list:\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO IGNORE_SERVER_IDS = ();\n\nRESET SLAVE ALL has no effect on the server ID list. This issue is\nfixed in MySQL 5.7. (Bug #18816897)\n\nIf IGNORE_SERVER_IDS contains the server\'s own ID and the server was\nstarted with the --replicate-same-server-id option enabled, an error\nresults.\n\nAlso beginning with MySQL 5.5, the master.info file and the output of\nSHOW SLAVE STATUS are extended to provide the list of servers that are\ncurrently ignored. For more information, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/slave-logs-status.html, and\n[HELP SHOW SLAVE STATUS].\n\nBeginning with MySQL 5.5.5, invoking CHANGE MASTER TO causes the\nprevious values for MASTER_HOST, MASTER_PORT, MASTER_LOG_FILE, and\nMASTER_LOG_POS to be written to the error log, along with other\ninformation about the slave\'s state prior to execution.\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO is useful for setting up a slave when you have the\nsnapshot of the master and have recorded the master binary log\ncoordinates corresponding to the time of the snapshot. After loading\nthe snapshot into the slave to synchronize it with the master, you can\nrun CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_FILE=\'log_name\', MASTER_LOG_POS=log_pos\non the slave to specify the coordinates at which the slave should begin\nreading the master binary log.\n\nThe following example changes the master server the slave uses and\nestablishes the master binary log coordinates from which the slave\nbegins reading. This is used when you want to set up the slave to\nreplicate the master:\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO\n  MASTER_HOST=\'master2.mycompany.com\',\n  MASTER_USER=\'replication\',\n  MASTER_PASSWORD=\'bigs3cret\',\n  MASTER_PORT=3306,\n  MASTER_LOG_FILE=\'master2-bin.001\',\n  MASTER_LOG_POS=4,\n  MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY=10;\n\nThe next example shows an operation that is less frequently employed.\nIt is used when the slave has relay log files that you want it to\nexecute again for some reason. To do this, the master need not be\nreachable. You need only use CHANGE MASTER TO and start the SQL thread\n(START SLAVE SQL_THREAD):\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO\n  RELAY_LOG_FILE=\'slave-relay-bin.006\',\n  RELAY_LOG_POS=4025;\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/change-master-to.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/change-master-to.html'),(188,'DROP DATABASE',40,'Syntax:\nDROP {DATABASE | SCHEMA} [IF EXISTS] db_name\n\nDROP DATABASE drops all tables in the database and deletes the\ndatabase.

One data file is\ncreated and added to the tablespace using this statement. Additional\ndata files may be added to the tablespace by using the ALTER TABLESPACE\nstatement (see [HELP ALTER TABLESPACE]). For rules covering the naming\nof tablespaces, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/identifiers.html.\n\n*Note*: All MySQL Cluster Disk Data objects share the same namespace.\nThis means that each Disk Data object must be uniquely named (and not\nmerely each Disk Data object of a given type). For example, you cannot\nhave a tablespace and a log file group with the same name, or a\ntablespace and a data file with the same name.\n\nA log file group of one or more UNDO log files must be assigned to the\ntablespace to be created with the USE LOGFILE GROUP clause.\nlogfile_group must be an existing log file group created with CREATE\nLOGFILE GROUP (see [HELP CREATE LOGFILE GROUP]). Multiple tablespaces\nmay use the same log file group for UNDO logging.\n\nThe EXTENT_SIZE sets the size, in bytes, of the extents used by any\nfiles belonging to the tablespace. The default value is 1M. The minimum\nsize is 32K, and theoretical maximum is 2G, although the practical\nmaximum size depends on a number of factors. In most cases, changing\nthe extent size does not have any measurable effect on performance, and\nthe default value is recommended for all but the most unusual\nsituations.\n\nAn extent is a unit of disk space allocation. One extent is filled with\nas much data as that extent can contain before another extent is used.\nIn theory, up to 65,535 (64K) extents may used per data file; however,\nthe recommended maximum is 32,768 (32K). The recommended maximum size\nfor a single data file is 32G---that is, 32K extents x 1 MB per extent.\nIn addition, once an extent is allocated to a given partition, it\ncannot be used to store data from a different partition; an extent\ncannot store data from more than one partition. This means, for example\nthat a tablespace having a single datafile whose INITIAL_SIZE is 256 MB\nand whose EXTENT_SIZE is 128M has just two extents, and so can be used\nto store data from at most two different disk data table partitions.\n\nYou can see how many extents remain free in a given data file by\nquerying the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES table, and so derive an estimate\nfor how much space remains free in the file. For further discussion and\nexamples, see http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/files-table.html.\n\nThe INITIAL_SIZE parameter sets the data file\'s total size in bytes.\nOnce the file has been created, its size cannot be changed; however,\nyou can add more data files to the tablespace using ALTER TABLESPACE\n... ADD DATAFILE. See [HELP ALTER TABLESPACE].\n\nINITIAL_SIZE is optional; its default value is 134217728 (128 MB).\n\nOn 32-bit systems, the maximum supported value for INITIAL_SIZE is\n4294967296 (4 GB). (Bug #29186)\n\nWhen setting EXTENT_SIZE, you may optionally follow the number with a\none-letter abbreviation for an order of magnitude, similar to those\nused in my.cnf. Generally, this is one of the letters M (for megabytes)\nor G (for gigabytes). In MySQL Cluster NDB 7.2.14 and later, these\nabbreviations are also supported when specifying INITIAL_SIZE as well.\n(Bug #13116514, Bug #16104705, Bug #62858)\n\nINITIAL_SIZE, EXTENT_SIZE, and UNDO_BUFFER_SIZE are subject to rounding\nas follows:\n\no EXTENT_SIZE and UNDO_BUFFER_SIZE are each rounded up to the nearest\n  whole multiple of 32K.\n\no INITIAL_SIZE is rounded down to the nearest whole multiple of 32K.\n\n  For data files, INITIAL_SIZE is subject to further rounding; the\n  result just obtained is rounded up to the nearest whole multiple of\n  EXTENT_SIZE (after any rounding).\n\nThe rounding just described is done explicitly, and a warning is issued\nby the MySQL Server when any such rounding is performed. The rounded\nvalues are also used by the NDB kernel for calculating\nINFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES column values and other purposes. However, to\navoid an unexpected result, we suggest that you always use whole\nmultiples of 32K in specifying these options.\n\nAUTOEXTEND_SIZE, MAX_SIZE, NODEGROUP, WAIT, and COMMENT are parsed but\nignored, and so currently have no effect. These options are intended\nfor future expansion.\n\nThe ENGINE parameter determines the storage engine which uses this\ntablespace, with engine_name being the name of the storage engine.\nCurrently, engine_name must be one of the values NDB or NDBCLUSTER.\n\nWhen CREATE TABLESPACE is used with ENGINE = NDB, a tablespace and\nassociated data file are created on each Cluster data node. You can\nverify that the data files were created and obtain information about\nthem by querying the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES table. For example:\n\nmysql> SELECT LOGFILE_GROUP_NAME, FILE_NAME, EXTRA\n    -> FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES\n    -> WHERE TABLESPACE_NAME = \'newts\' AND FILE_TYPE = \'DATAFILE\';\n+--------------------+-------------+----------------+\n| LOGFILE_GROUP_NAME | FILE_NAME   | EXTRA          |\n+--------------------+-------------+----------------+\n| lg_3               | newdata.dat | CLUSTER_NODE=3 |\n| lg_3               | newdata.dat | CLUSTER_NODE=4 |\n+--------------------+-------------+----------------+\n2 rows in set (0.01 sec)\n\n(See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/files-table.html.)\n\nCREATE TABLESPACE is useful only with Disk Data storage for MySQL\nCluster.

GRANT\nalso serves to specify other account characteristics such as use of\nsecure connections and limits on access to server resources. To use\nGRANT, you must have the GRANT OPTION privilege, and you must have the\nprivileges that you are granting.\n\nNormally, a database administrator first uses CREATE USER to create an\naccount, then GRANT to define its privileges and characteristics. For\nexample:\n\nCREATE USER \'jeffrey\'@\'localhost\' IDENTIFIED BY \'mypass\';\nGRANT ALL ON db1.* TO \'jeffrey\'@\'localhost\';\nGRANT SELECT ON db2.invoice TO \'jeffrey\'@\'localhost\';\nGRANT USAGE ON *.* TO \'jeffrey\'@\'localhost\' WITH MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR 90;\n\nHowever, if an account named in a GRANT statement does not already\nexist, GRANT may create it under the conditions described later in the\ndiscussion of the NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER SQL mode.\n\nThe REVOKE statement is related to GRANT and enables administrators to\nremove account privileges. See [HELP REVOKE].\n\nWhen successfully executed from the mysql program, GRANT responds with\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected. To determine what privileges result from the\noperation, use SHOW GRANTS.

In practice, the\nDESCRIBE keyword is more often used to obtain information about table\nstructure, whereas EXPLAIN is used to obtain a query execution plan\n(that is, an explanation of how MySQL would execute a query). The\nfollowing discussion uses the DESCRIBE and EXPLAIN keywords in\naccordance with those uses, but the MySQL parser treats them as\ncompletely synonymous.\n\nObtaining Table Structure Information\n\nDESCRIBE provides information about the columns in a table:\n\nmysql> DESCRIBE City;\n+------------+----------+------+-----+---------+----------------+\n| Field      | Type     | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |\n+------------+----------+------+-----+---------+----------------+\n| Id         | int(11)  | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |\n| Name       | char(35) | NO   |     |         |                |\n| Country    | char(3)  | NO   | UNI |         |                |\n| District   | char(20) | YES  | MUL |         |                |\n| Population | int(11)  | NO   |     | 0       |                |\n+------------+----------+------+-----+---------+----------------+\n\nDESCRIBE is a shortcut for SHOW COLUMNS. These statements also display\ninformation for views. The description for SHOW COLUMNS provides more\ninformation about the output columns. See [HELP SHOW COLUMNS].\n\nBy default, DESCRIBE displays information about all columns in the\ntable. col_name, if given, is the name of a column in the table. In\nthis case, the statement displays information only for the named\ncolumn. wild, if given, is a pattern string. It can contain the SQL \"%\"\nand \"_\" wildcard characters. In this case, the statement displays\noutput only for the columns with names matching the string. There is no\nneed to enclose the string within quotation marks unless it contains\nspaces or other special characters.\n\nThe DESCRIBE statement is provided for compatibility with Oracle.\n\nThe SHOW CREATE TABLE, SHOW TABLE STATUS, and SHOW INDEX statements\nalso provide information about tables. See [HELP SHOW].\n\nObtaining Execution Plan Information\n\nThe EXPLAIN statement provides information about how MySQL executes\nstatements:\n\no When you precede a SELECT statement with the keyword EXPLAIN, MySQL\n  displays information from the optimizer about the statement execution\n  plan. That is, MySQL explains how it would process the statement,\n  including information about how tables are joined and in which order.\n  For information about using EXPLAIN to obtain execution plan\n  information, see\n  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/explain-output.html.\n\no EXPLAIN EXTENDED can be used to obtain additional execution plan\n  information. See\n  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/explain-extended.html.\n\no EXPLAIN PARTITIONS is useful for examining queries involving\n  partitioned tables. See\n  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/partitioning-info.html.\n\nWith the help of EXPLAIN, you can see where you should add indexes to\ntables so that the statement executes faster by using indexes to find\nrows. You can also use EXPLAIN to check whether the optimizer joins the\ntables in an optimal order. To give a hint to the optimizer to use a\njoin order corresponding to the order in which the tables are named in\na SELECT statement, begin the statement with SELECT STRAIGHT_JOIN\nrather than just SELECT. (See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/select.html.)\n\nIf you have a problem with indexes not being used when you believe that\nthey should be, run ANALYZE TABLE to update table statistics, such as\ncardinality of keys, that can affect the choices the optimizer makes.\nSee [HELP ANALYZE TABLE].\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/explain.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/explain.html'),(259,'DEGREES',3,'Syntax:\nDEGREES(X)\n\nReturns the argument X, converted from radians to degrees.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/mathematical-functions.html\n\n','mysql> SELECT DEGREES(PI());\n        -> 180\nmysql> SELECT DEGREES(PI() / 2);\n        -> 90\n','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/mathematical-functions.html'),(260,'- UNARY',3,'Syntax:\n-\n\nUnary minus.

This means that timestamp settings in the\nbinary log have no effect on invocations of SYSDATE().\n\nBecause SYSDATE() can return different values even within the same\nstatement, and is not affected by SET TIMESTAMP, it is nondeterministic\nand therefore unsafe for replication if statement-based binary logging\nis used.

See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/adding-functions.html. A UDF can\nbe regarded as an external stored function. Stored functions share\ntheir namespace with UDFs. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/function-resolution.html, for\nthe rules describing how the server interprets references to different\nkinds of functions.\n\nTo invoke a stored procedure, use the CALL statement (see [HELP CALL]).\nTo invoke a stored function, refer to it in an expression. The function\nreturns a value during expression evaluation.\n\nCREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION require the CREATE ROUTINE\nprivilege. They might also require the SUPER privilege, depending on\nthe DEFINER value, as described later in this section. If binary\nlogging is enabled, CREATE FUNCTION might require the SUPER privilege,\nas described in\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/stored-programs-logging.html.\n\nBy default, MySQL automatically grants the ALTER ROUTINE and EXECUTE\nprivileges to the routine creator. This behavior can be changed by\ndisabling the automatic_sp_privileges system variable. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/stored-routines-privileges.html.\n\nThe DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses specify the security context to be\nused when checking access privileges at routine execution time, as\ndescribed later in this section.\n\nIf the routine name is the same as the name of a built-in SQL function,\na syntax error occurs unless you use a space between the name and the\nfollowing parenthesis when defining the routine or invoking it later.\nFor this reason, avoid using the names of existing SQL functions for\nyour own stored routines.\n\nThe IGNORE_SPACE SQL mode applies to built-in functions, not to stored\nroutines. It is always permissible to have spaces after a stored\nroutine name, regardless of whether IGNORE_SPACE is enabled.\n\nThe parameter list enclosed within parentheses must always be present.\nIf there are no parameters, an empty parameter list of () should be\nused. Parameter names are not case sensitive.\n\nEach parameter is an IN parameter by default. To specify otherwise for\na parameter, use the keyword OUT or INOUT before the parameter name.\n\n*Note*: Specifying a parameter as IN, OUT, or INOUT is valid only for a\nPROCEDURE. For a FUNCTION, parameters are always regarded as IN\nparameters.\n\nAn IN parameter passes a value into a procedure. The procedure might\nmodify the value, but the modification is not visible to the caller\nwhen the procedure returns. An OUT parameter passes a value from the\nprocedure back to the caller. Its initial value is NULL within the\nprocedure, and its value is visible to the caller when the procedure\nreturns. An INOUT parameter is initialized by the caller, can be\nmodified by the procedure, and any change made by the procedure is\nvisible to the caller when the procedure returns.\n\nFor each OUT or INOUT parameter, pass a user-defined variable in the\nCALL statement that invokes the procedure so that you can obtain its\nvalue when the procedure returns. If you are calling the procedure from\nwithin another stored procedure or function, you can also pass a\nroutine parameter or local routine variable as an IN or INOUT\nparameter.\n\nRoutine parameters cannot be referenced in statements prepared within\nthe routine; see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/stored-program-restrictions.html\n.\n\nThe following example shows a simple stored procedure that uses an OUT\nparameter:\n\nmysql> delimiter //\n\nmysql> CREATE PROCEDURE simpleproc (OUT param1 INT)\n    -> BEGIN\n    ->   SELECT COUNT(*) INTO param1 FROM t;\n    -> END//\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> delimiter ;\n\nmysql> CALL simpleproc(@a);\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT @a;\n+------+\n| @a   |\n+------+\n| 3    |\n+------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nThe example uses the mysql client delimiter command to change the\nstatement delimiter from ; to // while the procedure is being defined.\nThis enables the ; delimiter used in the procedure body to be passed\nthrough to the server rather than being interpreted by mysql itself.\nSee\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/stored-programs-defining.html.\n\nThe RETURNS clause may be specified only for a FUNCTION, for which it\nis mandatory. It indicates the return type of the function, and the\nfunction body must contain a RETURN value statement. If the RETURN\nstatement returns a value of a different type, the value is coerced to\nthe proper type. For example, if a function specifies an ENUM or SET\nvalue in the RETURNS clause, but the RETURN statement returns an\ninteger, the value returned from the function is the string for the\ncorresponding ENUM member of set of SET members.\n\nThe following example function takes a parameter, performs an operation\nusing an SQL function, and returns the result. In this case, it is\nunnecessary to use delimiter because the function definition contains\nno internal ; statement delimiters:\n\nmysql> CREATE FUNCTION hello (s CHAR(20))\nmysql> RETURNS CHAR(50) DETERMINISTIC\n    -> RETURN CONCAT(\'Hello, \',s,\'!\');\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT hello(\'world\');\n+----------------+\n| hello(\'world\') |\n+----------------+\n| Hello, world!  |\n+----------------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nParameter types and function return types can be declared to use any\nvalid data type, except that the COLLATE attribute cannot be used prior\nto MySQL 5.5.3. As of 5.5.3, COLLATE can be used if preceded by the\nCHARACTER SET attribute.\n\nThe routine_body consists of a valid SQL routine statement. This can be\na simple statement such as SELECT or INSERT, or a compound statement\nwritten using BEGIN and END. Compound statements can contain\ndeclarations, loops, and other control structure statements. The syntax\nfor these statements is described in\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/sql-syntax-compound-statements.h\ntml.\n\nMySQL permits routines to contain DDL statements, such as CREATE and\nDROP. MySQL also permits stored procedures (but not stored functions)\nto contain SQL transaction statements such as COMMIT. Stored functions\nmay not contain statements that perform explicit or implicit commit or\nrollback. Support for these statements is not required by the SQL\nstandard, which states that each DBMS vendor may decide whether to\npermit them.\n\nStatements that return a result set can be used within a stored\nprocedure but not within a stored function. This prohibition includes\nSELECT statements that do not have an INTO var_list clause and other\nstatements such as SHOW, EXPLAIN, and CHECK TABLE. For statements that\ncan be determined at function definition time to return a result set, a\nNot allowed to return a result set from a function error occurs\n(ER_SP_NO_RETSET).

It\nrequires the PROCESS privilege. The statement has these variants:\n\nSHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS\nSHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX\nSHOW ENGINE {NDB | NDBCLUSTER} STATUS\nSHOW ENGINE PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA STATUS\n\nSHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS displays extensive information from the\nstandard InnoDB Monitor about the state of the InnoDB storage engine.\nFor information about the standard monitor and other InnoDB Monitors\nthat provide information about InnoDB processing, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-monitors.html.\n\nSHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX displays InnoDB mutex and rw-lock statistics.\nStatement output has the following columns:\n\no Type\n\n  Always InnoDB.\n\no Name\n\n  The source file where the mutex is implemented, and the line number\n  in the file where the mutex is created. The line number is specific\n  to your version of MySQL.\n\no Status\n\n  The mutex status. This field displays several values if UNIV_DEBUG\n  was defined at MySQL compilation time (for example, in include/univ.i\n  in the InnoDB part of the MySQL source tree). If UNIV_DEBUG was not\n  defined, the statement displays only the os_waits value. In the\n  latter case (without UNIV_DEBUG), the information on which the output\n  is based is insufficient to distinguish regular mutexes and mutexes\n  that protect rw-locks (which permit multiple readers or a single\n  writer). Consequently, the output may appear to contain multiple rows\n  for the same mutex.\n\n  o count indicates how many times the mutex was requested.\n\n  o spin_waits indicates how many times the spinlock had to run.\n\n  o spin_rounds indicates the number of spinlock rounds. (spin_rounds\n    divided by spin_waits provides the average round count.)\n\n  o os_waits indicates the number of operating system waits. This\n    occurs when the spinlock did not work (the mutex was not locked\n    during the spinlock and it was necessary to yield to the operating\n    system and wait).\n\n  o os_yields indicates the number of times a thread trying to lock a\n    mutex gave up its timeslice and yielded to the operating system (on\n    the presumption that permitting other threads to run will free the\n    mutex so that it can be locked).\n\n  o os_wait_times indicates the amount of time (in ms) spent in\n    operating system waits. In MySQL 5.5 timing is disabled and this\n    value is always 0.\n\nAs of MySQL 5.5, SHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX skips the mutexes and\nrw-locks of buffer pool blocks, as the amount of output can be\noverwhelming on systems with a large buffer pool. (There is one mutex\nand one rw-lock in each 16K buffer pool block, and there are 65,536\nblocks per gigabyte.) SHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX also does not list any\nmutexes or rw-locks that have never been waited on (os_waits=0). Thus,\nSHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX only displays information about mutexes and\nrw-locks outside of the buffer pool that have caused at least one\nOS-level wait.\n\nSHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX information can be used to diagnose system\nproblems. For example, large values of spin_waits and spin_rounds may\nindicate scalability problems.\n\nUse SHOW ENGINE PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA STATUS to inspect the internal\noperation of the Performance Schema code:\n\nmysql> SHOW ENGINE PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA STATUS\\G\n...\n*************************** 3. row ***************************\n  Type: performance_schema\n  Name: events_waits_history.row_size\nStatus: 76\n*************************** 4. row ***************************\n  Type: performance_schema\n  Name: events_waits_history.row_count\nStatus: 10000\n*************************** 5. row ***************************\n  Type: performance_schema\n  Name: events_waits_history.memory\nStatus: 760000\n...\n*************************** 57. row ***************************\n  Type: performance_schema\n  Name: performance_schema.memory\nStatus: 26459600\n...\n\nThis statement is intended to help the DBA understand the effects that\ndifferent Performance Schema options have on memory requirements.\n\nName values consist of two parts, which name an internal buffer and a\nbuffer attribute, respectively. Interpret buffer names as follows:\n\no An internal buffer that is not exposed as a table is named within\n  parentheses. Examples: (pfs_cond_class).row_size,\n  (pfs_mutex_class).memory.\n\no An internal buffer that is exposed as a table in the\n  performance_schema database is named after the table, without\n  parentheses. Examples: events_waits_history.row_size,\n  mutex_instances.row_count.\n\no A value that applies to the Performance Schema as a whole begins with\n  performance_schema. Example: performance_schema.memory.\n\nBuffer attributes have these meanings:\n\no row_size is the size of the internal record used by the\n  implementation, such as the size of a row in a table. row_size values\n  cannot be changed.\n\no row_count is the number of internal records, such as the number of\n  rows in a table. row_count values can be changed using Performance\n  Schema configuration options.\n\no For a table, tbl_name.memory is the product of row_size and\n  row_count. For the Performance Schema as a whole,\n  performance_schema.memory is the sum of all the memory used (the sum\n  of all other memory values).\n\nIn some cases, there is a direct relationship between a Performance\nSchema configuration parameter and a SHOW ENGINE value. For example,\nevents_waits_history_long.row_count corresponds to\nperformance_schema_events_waits_history_long_size. In other cases, the\nrelationship is more complex. For example,\nevents_waits_history.row_count corresponds to\nperformance_schema_events_waits_history_size (the number of rows per\nthread) multiplied by performance_schema_max_thread_instances ( the\nnumber of threads).\n\nIf the server has the NDBCLUSTER storage engine enabled, SHOW ENGINE\nNDB STATUS displays cluster status information such as the number of\nconnected data nodes, the cluster connectstring, and cluster binlog\nepochs, as well as counts of various Cluster API objects created by the\nMySQL Server when connected to the cluster.

It requires the INSERT\nprivilege for the mysql.plugin table.\n\nplugin_name is the name of the plugin as defined in the plugin\ndescriptor structure contained in the library file (see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/plugin-data-structures.html).\nPlugin names are not case sensitive. For maximal compatibility, plugin\nnames should be limited to ASCII letters, digits, and underscore\nbecause they are used in C source files, shell command lines, M4 and\nBourne shell scripts, and SQL environments.\n\nshared_library_name is the name of the shared library that contains the\nplugin code. The name includes the file name extension (for example,\nlibmyplugin.so, libmyplugin.dll, or libmyplugin.dylib).\n\nThe shared library must be located in the plugin directory (the\ndirectory named by the plugin_dir system variable). The library must be\nin the plugin directory itself, not in a subdirectory. By default,\nplugin_dir is the plugin directory under the directory named by the\npkglibdir configuration variable, but it can be changed by setting the\nvalue of plugin_dir at server startup. For example, set its value in a\nmy.cnf file:\n\n[mysqld]\nplugin_dir=/path/to/plugin/directory\n\nIf the value of plugin_dir is a relative path name, it is taken to be\nrelative to the MySQL base directory (the value of the basedir system\nvariable).\n\nINSTALL PLUGIN loads and initializes the plugin code to make the plugin\navailable for use. A plugin is initialized by executing its\ninitialization function, which handles any setup that the plugin must\nperform before it can be used. When the server shuts down, it executes\nthe deinitialization function for each plugin that is loaded so that\nthe plugin has a change to perform any final cleanup.\n\nINSTALL PLUGIN also registers the plugin by adding a line that\nindicates the plugin name and library file name to the mysql.plugin\ntable. At server startup, the server loads and initializes any plugin\nthat is listed in the mysql.plugin table. This means that a plugin is\ninstalled with INSTALL PLUGIN only once, not every time the server\nstarts. Plugin loading at startup does not occur if the server is\nstarted with the --skip-grant-tables option.\n\nA plugin library can contain multiple plugins. For each of them to be\ninstalled, use a separate INSTALL PLUGIN statement. Each statement\nnames a different plugin, but all of them specify the same library\nname.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/install-plugin.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/install-plugin.html'),(422,'DECLARE CURSOR',24,'Syntax:\nDECLARE cursor_name CURSOR FOR select_statement\n\nThis statement declares a cursor and associates it with a SELECT\nstatement that retrieves the rows to be traversed by the cursor.

LOAD DATA INFILE is the complement of SELECT ...\nINTO OUTFILE. (See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/select-into.html.) To write data\nfrom a table to a file, use SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE. To read the file\nback into a table, use LOAD DATA INFILE. The syntax of the FIELDS and\nLINES clauses is the same for both statements. Both clauses are\noptional, but FIELDS must precede LINES if both are specified.\n\nYou can also load data files by using the mysqlimport utility; it\noperates by sending a LOAD DATA INFILE statement to the server. The\n--local option causes mysqlimport to read data files from the client\nhost. You can specify the --compress option to get better performance\nover slow networks if the client and server support the compressed\nprotocol. See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/mysqlimport.html.\n\nFor more information about the efficiency of INSERT versus LOAD DATA\nINFILE and speeding up LOAD DATA INFILE, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/insert-speed.html.\n\nThe file name must be given as a literal string. On Windows, specify\nbackslashes in path names as forward slashes or doubled backslashes.\nThe character_set_filesystem system variable controls the\ninterpretation of the file name.\n\nThe character set indicated by the character_set_database system\nvariable is used to interpret the information in the file. SET NAMES\nand the setting of character_set_client do not affect interpretation of\ninput. If the contents of the input file use a character set that\ndiffers from the default, it is usually preferable to specify the\ncharacter set of the file by using the CHARACTER SET clause. A\ncharacter set of binary specifies \"no conversion.\"\n\nLOAD DATA INFILE interprets all fields in the file as having the same\ncharacter set, regardless of the data types of the columns into which\nfield values are loaded. For proper interpretation of file contents,\nyou must ensure that it was written with the correct character set. For\nexample, if you write a data file with mysqldump -T or by issuing a\nSELECT ... INTO OUTFILE statement in mysql, be sure to use a\n--default-character-set option so that output is written in the\ncharacter set to be used when the file is loaded with LOAD DATA INFILE.\n\n*Note*: It is not possible to load data files that use the ucs2, utf16,\nor utf32 character set.\n\nIf you use LOW_PRIORITY, execution of the LOAD DATA statement is\ndelayed until no other clients are reading from the table. This affects\nonly storage engines that use only table-level locking (such as MyISAM,\nMEMORY, and MERGE).\n\nIf you specify CONCURRENT with a MyISAM table that satisfies the\ncondition for concurrent inserts (that is, it contains no free blocks\nin the middle), other threads can retrieve data from the table while\nLOAD DATA is executing. This option affects the performance of LOAD\nDATA a bit, even if no other thread is using the table at the same\ntime.\n\nWith row-based replication, CONCURRENT is replicated regardless of\nMySQL version. With statement-based replication CONCURRENT is not\nreplicated prior to MySQL 5.5.1 (see Bug #34628). For more information,\nsee\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/replication-features-load-data.h\ntml.\n\nThe LOCAL keyword affects expected location of the file and error\nhandling, as described later. LOCAL works only if your server and your\nclient both have been configured to permit it. For example, if mysqld\nwas started with --local-infile=0, LOCAL does not work. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/load-data-local.html.\n\nThe LOCAL keyword affects where the file is expected to be found:\n\no If LOCAL is specified, the file is read by the client program on the\n  client host and sent to the server. The file can be given as a full\n  path name to specify its exact location. If given as a relative path\n  name, the name is interpreted relative to the directory in which the\n  client program was started.\n\n  When using LOCAL with LOAD DATA, a copy of the file is created in the\n  server\'s temporary directory. This is not the directory determined by\n  the value of tmpdir or slave_load_tmpdir, but rather the operating\n  system\'s temporary directory, and is not configurable in the MySQL\n  Server. (Typically the system temporary directory is /tmp on Linux\n  systems and C:\\WINDOWS\\TEMP on Windows.) Lack of sufficient space for\n  the copy in this directory can cause the LOAD DATA LOCAL statement to\n  fail.\n\no If LOCAL is not specified, the file must be located on the server\n  host and is read directly by the server. The server uses the\n  following rules to locate the file:\n\n  o If the file name is an absolute path name, the server uses it as\n    given.\n\n  o If the file name is a relative path name with one or more leading\n    components, the server searches for the file relative to the\n    server\'s data directory.\n\n  o If a file name with no leading components is given, the server\n    looks for the file in the database directory of the default\n    database.\n\nIn the non-LOCAL case, these rules mean that a file named as\n./myfile.txt is read from the server\'s data directory, whereas the file\nnamed as myfile.txt is read from the database directory of the default\ndatabase. For example, if db1 is the default database, the following\nLOAD DATA statement reads the file data.txt from the database directory\nfor db1, even though the statement explicitly loads the file into a\ntable in the db2 database:\n\nLOAD DATA INFILE \'data.txt\' INTO TABLE db2.my_table;\n\nFor security reasons, when reading text files located on the server,\nthe files must either reside in the database directory or be readable\nby all. Also, to use LOAD DATA INFILE on server files, you must have\nthe FILE privilege. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/privileges-provided.html. For\nnon-LOCAL load operations, if the secure_file_priv system variable is\nset to a nonempty directory name, the file to be loaded must be located\nin that directory.\n\nUsing LOCAL is a bit slower than letting the server access the files\ndirectly, because the contents of the file must be sent over the\nconnection by the client to the server. On the other hand, you do not\nneed the FILE privilege to load local files.\n\nLOCAL also affects error handling:\n\no With LOAD DATA INFILE, data-interpretation and duplicate-key errors\n  terminate the operation.\n\no With LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE, data-interpretation and duplicate-key\n  errors become warnings and the operation continues because the server\n  has no way to stop transmission of the file in the middle of the\n  operation. For duplicate-key errors, this is the same as if IGNORE is\n  specified. IGNORE is explained further later in this section.\n\nThe REPLACE and IGNORE keywords control handling of input rows that\nduplicate existing rows on unique key values:\n\no If you specify REPLACE, input rows replace existing rows. In other\n  words, rows that have the same value for a primary key or unique\n  index as an existing row. See [HELP REPLACE].\n\no If you specify IGNORE, input rows that duplicate an existing row on a\n  unique key value are skipped.\n\no If you do not specify either option, the behavior depends on whether\n  the LOCAL keyword is specified. Without LOCAL, an error occurs when a\n  duplicate key value is found, and the rest of the text file is\n  ignored. With LOCAL, the default behavior is the same as if IGNORE is\n  specified; this is because the server has no way to stop transmission\n  of the file in the middle of the operation.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/load-data.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/load-data.html'),(424,'MULTILINESTRING',25,'MultiLineString(ls1,ls2,...)\n\nConstructs a MultiLineString value using LineString or WKB LineString\narguments.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/gis-mysql-specific-functions.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/gis-mysql-specific-functions.html'),(425,'LOCALTIME',32,'Syntax:\nLOCALTIME, LOCALTIME()\n\nLOCALTIME and LOCALTIME() are synonyms for NOW().\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/date-and-time-functions.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/date-and-time-functions.html'),(426,'SHOW RELAYLOG EVENTS',27,'Syntax:\nSHOW RELAYLOG EVENTS\n   [IN \'log_name\'] [FROM pos] [LIMIT [offset,] row_count]\n\nShows the events in the relay log of a replication slave.

An xid is an XA transaction identifier. It indicates\nwhich transaction the statement applies to. xid values are supplied by\nthe client, or generated by the MySQL server. An xid value has from one\nto three parts:\n\nxid: gtrid [, bqual [, formatID ]]\n\ngtrid is a global transaction identifier, bqual is a branch qualifier,\nand formatID is a number that identifies the format used by the gtrid\nand bqual values. As indicated by the syntax, bqual and formatID are\noptional. The default bqual value is \'\' if not given. The default\nformatID value is 1 if not given.\n\ngtrid and bqual must be string literals, each up to 64 bytes (not\ncharacters) long. gtrid and bqual can be specified in several ways. You\ncan use a quoted string (\'ab\'), hex string (0x6162, X\'ab\'), or bit\nvalue (b\'nnnn\').\n\nformatID is an unsigned integer.\n\nThe gtrid and bqual values are interpreted in bytes by the MySQL\nserver\'s underlying XA support routines. However, while an SQL\nstatement containing an XA statement is being parsed, the server works\nwith some specific character set. To be safe, write gtrid and bqual as\nhex strings.\n\nxid values typically are generated by the Transaction Manager. Values\ngenerated by one TM must be different from values generated by other\nTMs. A given TM must be able to recognize its own xid values in a list\nof values returned by the XA RECOVER statement.\n\nFor XA START xid starts an XA transaction with the given xid value.\nEach XA transaction must have a unique xid value, so the value must not\ncurrently be used by another XA transaction. Uniqueness is assessed\nusing the gtrid and bqual values. All following XA statements for the\nXA transaction must be specified using the same xid value as that given\nin the XA START statement. If you use any of those statements but\nspecify an xid value that does not correspond to some existing XA\ntransaction, an error occurs.\n\nOne or more XA transactions can be part of the same global transaction.\nAll XA transactions within a given global transaction must use the same\ngtrid value in the xid value. For this reason, gtrid values must be\nglobally unique so that there is no ambiguity about which global\ntransaction a given XA transaction is part of. The bqual part of the\nxid value must be different for each XA transaction within a global\ntransaction. (The requirement that bqual values be different is a\nlimitation of the current MySQL XA implementation. It is not part of\nthe XA specification.)\n\nThe XA RECOVER statement returns information for those XA transactions\non the MySQL server that are in the PREPARED state. (See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/xa-states.html.) The output\nincludes a row for each such XA transaction on the server, regardless\nof which client started it.\n\nXA RECOVER output rows look like this (for an example xid value\nconsisting of the parts \'abc\', \'def\', and 7):\n\nmysql> XA RECOVER;\n+----------+--------------+--------------+--------+\n| formatID | gtrid_length | bqual_length | data   |\n+----------+--------------+--------------+--------+\n|        7 |            3 |            3 | abcdef |\n+----------+--------------+--------------+--------+\n\nThe output columns have the following meanings:\n\no formatID is the formatID part of the transaction xid\n\no gtrid_length is the length in bytes of the gtrid part of the xid\n\no bqual_length is the length in bytes of the bqual part of the xid\n\no data is the concatenation of the gtrid and bqual parts of the xid\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/xa-statements.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/xa-statements.html'),(438,'EQUALS',31,'Equals(g1,g2)\n\nReturns 1 or 0 to indicate whether g1 is spatially equal to g2.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/spatial-relation-functions-mbr.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/spatial-relation-functions-mbr.html'),(439,'SHOW CREATE VIEW',27,'Syntax:\nSHOW CREATE VIEW view_name\n\nThis statement shows the CREATE VIEW statement that creates the named\nview.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/show-create-view.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/show-create-view.html'),(440,'INTERVAL',19,'Syntax:\nINTERVAL(N,N1,N2,N3,...)\n\nReturns 0 if N < N1, 1 if N < N2 and so on or -1 if N is NULL.

You can enforce a high degree of\nconsistency with the default REPEATABLE READ level, for operations on\ncrucial data where ACID compliance is important. Or you can relax the\nconsistency rules with READ COMMITTED or even READ UNCOMMITTED, in\nsituations such as bulk reporting where precise consistency and\nrepeatable results are less important than minimizing the amount of\noverhead for locking. SERIALIZABLE enforces even stricter rules than\nREPEATABLE READ, and is used mainly in specialized situations, such as\nwith XA transactions and for troubleshooting issues with concurrency\nand deadlocks.\n\nFor full information about how these isolation levels work with InnoDB\ntransactions, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-transaction-model.html.\nIn particular, for additional information about InnoDB record-level\nlocks and how it uses them to execute various types of statements, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-record-level-locks.html\nand http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-locks-set.html.\n\nThe following list describes how MySQL supports the different\ntransaction levels. The list goes from the most commonly used level to\nthe least used.\n\no REPEATABLE READ\n\n  This is the default isolation level for InnoDB. For consistent reads,\n  there is an important difference from the READ COMMITTED isolation\n  level: All consistent reads within the same transaction read the\n  snapshot established by the first read. This convention means that if\n  you issue several plain (nonlocking) SELECT statements within the\n  same transaction, these SELECT statements are consistent also with\n  respect to each other. See\n  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-consistent-read.html.\n\n  For locking reads (SELECT with FOR UPDATE or LOCK IN SHARE MODE),\n  UPDATE, and DELETE statements, locking depends on whether the\n  statement uses a unique index with a unique search condition, or a\n  range-type search condition. For a unique index with a unique search\n  condition, InnoDB locks only the index record found, not the gap\n  before it. For other search conditions, InnoDB locks the index range\n  scanned, using gap locks or next-key (gap plus index-record) locks to\n  block insertions by other sessions into the gaps covered by the\n  range.\n\no READ COMMITTED\n\n  A somewhat Oracle-like isolation level with respect to consistent\n  (nonlocking) reads: Each consistent read, even within the same\n  transaction, sets and reads its own fresh snapshot. See\n  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-consistent-read.html.\n\n  For locking reads (SELECT with FOR UPDATE or LOCK IN SHARE MODE),\n  UPDATE statements, and DELETE statements, InnoDB locks only index\n  records, not the gaps before them, and thus permits the free\n  insertion of new records next to locked records.\n\n  *Note*: In MySQL 5.5, when READ COMMITTED isolation level is used or\n  the innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog system variable is enabled, there\n  is no InnoDB gap locking except for foreign-key constraint checking\n  and duplicate-key checking. Also, record locks for nonmatching rows\n  are released after MySQL has evaluated the WHERE condition. If you\n  use READ COMMITTED or enable innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog, you must\n  use row-based binary logging.\n\no READ UNCOMMITTED\n\n  SELECT statements are performed in a nonlocking fashion, but a\n  possible earlier version of a row might be used. Thus, using this\n  isolation level, such reads are not consistent. This is also called a\n  \"dirty read.\" Otherwise, this isolation level works like READ\n  COMMITTED.\n\no SERIALIZABLE\n\n  This level is like REPEATABLE READ, but InnoDB implicitly converts\n  all plain SELECT statements to SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE if\n  autocommit is disabled. If autocommit is enabled, the SELECT is its\n  own transaction. It therefore is known to be read only and can be\n  serialized if performed as a consistent (nonlocking) read and need\n  not block for other transactions. (To force a plain SELECT to block\n  if other transactions have modified the selected rows, disable\n  autocommit.)\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/set-transaction.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/set-transaction.html'),(451,'CEILING',3,'Syntax:\nCEILING(X)\n\nReturns the smallest integer value not less than X.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/mathematical-functions.html\n\n','mysql> SELECT CEILING(1.23);\n        -> 2\nmysql> SELECT CEILING(-1.23);\n        -> -1\n','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/mathematical-functions.html'),(452,'SIN',3,'Syntax:\nSIN(X)\n\nReturns the sine of X, where X is given in radians.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/mathematical-functions.html\n\n','mysql> SELECT SIN(PI());\n        -> 1.2246063538224e-16\nmysql> SELECT ROUND(SIN(PI()));\n        -> 0\n','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/mathematical-functions.html'),(453,'DAYOFWEEK',32,'Syntax:\nDAYOFWEEK(date)\n\nReturns the weekday index for date (1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 7 =\nSaturday).

If the view does not exist,\nCREATE OR REPLACE VIEW is the same as CREATE VIEW. If the view does\nexist, CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW is the same as ALTER VIEW.\n\nThe select_statement is a SELECT statement that provides the definition\nof the view. (When you select from the view, you select in effect using\nthe SELECT statement.) select_statement can select from base tables or\nother views.\n\nThe view definition is \"frozen\" at creation time, so changes to the\nunderlying tables afterward do not affect the view definition. For\nexample, if a view is defined as SELECT * on a table, new columns added\nto the table later do not become part of the view.\n\nThe ALGORITHM clause affects how MySQL processes the view. The DEFINER\nand SQL SECURITY clauses specify the security context to be used when\nchecking access privileges at view invocation time. The WITH CHECK\nOPTION clause can be given to constrain inserts or updates to rows in\ntables referenced by the view. These clauses are described later in\nthis section.\n\nThe CREATE VIEW statement requires the CREATE VIEW privilege for the\nview, and some privilege for each column selected by the SELECT\nstatement. For columns used elsewhere in the SELECT statement you must\nhave the SELECT privilege. If the OR REPLACE clause is present, you\nmust also have the DROP privilege for the view. CREATE VIEW might also\nrequire the SUPER privilege, depending on the DEFINER value, as\ndescribed later in this section.\n\nWhen a view is referenced, privilege checking occurs as described later\nin this section.\n\nA view belongs to a database. By default, a new view is created in the\ndefault database. To create the view explicitly in a given database,\nspecify the name as db_name.view_name when you create it:\n\nmysql> CREATE VIEW test.v AS SELECT * FROM t;\n\nWithin a database, base tables and views share the same namespace, so a\nbase table and a view cannot have the same name.\n\nColumns retrieved by the SELECT statement can be simple references to\ntable columns. They can also be expressions that use functions,\nconstant values, operators, and so forth.\n\nViews must have unique column names with no duplicates, just like base\ntables. By default, the names of the columns retrieved by the SELECT\nstatement are used for the view column names. To define explicit names\nfor the view columns, the optional column_list clause can be given as a\nlist of comma-separated identifiers. The number of names in column_list\nmust be the same as the number of columns retrieved by the SELECT\nstatement.\n\nUnqualified table or view names in the SELECT statement are interpreted\nwith respect to the default database. A view can refer to tables or\nviews in other databases by qualifying the table or view name with the\nproper database name.\n\nA view can be created from many kinds of SELECT statements. It can\nrefer to base tables or other views. It can use joins, UNION, and\nsubqueries. The SELECT need not even refer to any tables. The following\nexample defines a view that selects two columns from another table, as\nwell as an expression calculated from those columns:\n\nmysql> CREATE TABLE t (qty INT, price INT);\nmysql> INSERT INTO t VALUES(3, 50);\nmysql> CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT qty, price, qty*price AS value FROM t;\nmysql> SELECT * FROM v;\n+------+-------+-------+\n| qty  | price | value |\n+------+-------+-------+\n|    3 |    50 |   150 |\n+------+-------+-------+\n\nA view definition is subject to the following restrictions:\n\no The SELECT statement cannot contain a subquery in the FROM clause.\n\no The SELECT statement cannot refer to system or user variables.\n\no Within a stored program, the definition cannot refer to program\n  parameters or local variables.\n\no The SELECT statement cannot refer to prepared statement parameters.\n\no Any table or view referred to in the definition must exist. However,\n  after a view has been created, it is possible to drop a table or view\n  that the definition refers to. In this case, use of the view results\n  in an error. To check a view definition for problems of this kind,\n  use the CHECK TABLE statement.\n\no The definition cannot refer to a TEMPORARY table, and you cannot\n  create a TEMPORARY view.\n\no Any tables named in the view definition must exist at definition\n  time.\n\no You cannot associate a trigger with a view.\n\no Aliases for column names in the SELECT statement are checked against\n  the maximum column length of 64 characters (not the maximum alias\n  length of 256 characters).\n\nORDER BY is permitted in a view definition, but it is ignored if you\nselect from a view using a statement that has its own ORDER BY.\n\nFor other options or clauses in the definition, they are added to the\noptions or clauses of the statement that references the view, but the\neffect is undefined. For example, if a view definition includes a LIMIT\nclause, and you select from the view using a statement that has its own\nLIMIT clause, it is undefined which limit applies. This same principle\napplies to options such as ALL, DISTINCT, or SQL_SMALL_RESULT that\nfollow the SELECT keyword, and to clauses such as INTO, FOR UPDATE,\nLOCK IN SHARE MODE, and PROCEDURE.\n\nIf you create a view and then change the query processing environment\nby changing system variables, that may affect the results that you get\nfrom the view:\n\nmysql> CREATE VIEW v (mycol) AS SELECT \'abc\';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)\n\nmysql> SET sql_mode = \'\';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT \"mycol\" FROM v;\n+-------+\n| mycol |\n+-------+\n| mycol |\n+-------+\n1 row in set (0.01 sec)\n\nmysql> SET sql_mode = \'ANSI_QUOTES\';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT \"mycol\" FROM v;\n+-------+\n| mycol |\n+-------+\n| abc   |\n+-------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nThe DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses determine which MySQL account to\nuse when checking access privileges for the view when a statement is\nexecuted that references the view. The valid SQL SECURITY\ncharacteristic values are DEFINER and INVOKER. These indicate that the\nrequired privileges must be held by the user who defined or invoked the\nview, respectively. The default SQL SECURITY value is DEFINER.\n\nIf a user value is given for the DEFINER clause, it should be a MySQL\naccount specified as \'user_name\'@\'host_name\' (the same format used in\nthe GRANT statement), CURRENT_USER, or CURRENT_USER(). The default\nDEFINER value is the user who executes the CREATE VIEW statement. This\nis the same as specifying DEFINER = CURRENT_USER explicitly.\n\nIf you specify the DEFINER clause, these rules determine the valid\nDEFINER user values:\n\no If you do not have the SUPER privilege, the only valid user value is\n  your own account, either specified literally or by using\n  CURRENT_USER. You cannot set the definer to some other account.\n\no If you have the SUPER privilege, you can specify any syntactically\n  valid account name. If the account does not actually exist, a warning\n  is generated.\n\no Although it is possible to create a view with a nonexistent DEFINER\n  account, an error occurs when the view is referenced if the SQL\n  SECURITY value is DEFINER but the definer account does not exist.\n\nFor more information about view security, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/stored-programs-security.html.\n\nWithin a view definition, CURRENT_USER returns the view\'s DEFINER value\nby default. For views defined with the SQL SECURITY INVOKER\ncharacteristic, CURRENT_USER returns the account for the view\'s\ninvoker. For information about user auditing within views, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/account-activity-auditing.html.\n\nWithin a stored routine that is defined with the SQL SECURITY DEFINER\ncharacteristic, CURRENT_USER returns the routine\'s DEFINER value. This\nalso affects a view defined within such a routine, if the view\ndefinition contains a DEFINER value of CURRENT_USER.\n\nView privileges are checked like this:\n\no At view definition time, the view creator must have the privileges\n  needed to use the top-level objects accessed by the view. For\n  example, if the view definition refers to table columns, the creator\n  must have some privilege for each column in the select list of the\n  definition, and the SELECT privilege for each column used elsewhere\n  in the definition. If the definition refers to a stored function,\n  only the privileges needed to invoke the function can be checked. The\n  privileges required at function invocation time can be checked only\n  as it executes: For different invocations, different execution paths\n  within the function might be taken.\n\no The user who references a view must have appropriate privileges to\n  access it (SELECT to select from it, INSERT to insert into it, and so\n  forth.)\n\no When a view has been referenced, privileges for objects accessed by\n  the view are checked against the privileges held by the view DEFINER\n  account or invoker, depending on whether the SQL SECURITY\n  characteristic is DEFINER or INVOKER, respectively.\n\no If reference to a view causes execution of a stored function,\n  privilege checking for statements executed within the function depend\n  on whether the function SQL SECURITY characteristic is DEFINER or\n  INVOKER. If the security characteristic is DEFINER, the function runs\n  with the privileges of the DEFINER account. If the characteristic is\n  INVOKER, the function runs with the privileges determined by the\n  view\'s SQL SECURITY characteristic.\n\nExample: A view might depend on a stored function, and that function\nmight invoke other stored routines. For example, the following view\ninvokes a stored function f():\n\nCREATE VIEW v AS SELECT * FROM t WHERE t.id = f(t.name);\n\nSuppose that f() contains a statement such as this:\n\nIF name IS NULL then\n  CALL p1();\nELSE\n  CALL p2();\nEND IF;\n\nThe privileges required for executing statements within f() need to be\nchecked when f() executes. This might mean that privileges are needed\nfor p1() or p2(), depending on the execution path within f(). Those\nprivileges must be checked at runtime, and the user who must possess\nthe privileges is determined by the SQL SECURITY values of the view v\nand the function f().\n\nThe DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses for views are extensions to\nstandard SQL. In standard SQL, views are handled using the rules for\nSQL SECURITY DEFINER. The standard says that the definer of the view,\nwhich is the same as the owner of the view\'s schema, gets applicable\nprivileges on the view (for example, SELECT) and may grant them. MySQL\nhas no concept of a schema \"owner\", so MySQL adds a clause to identify\nthe definer. The DEFINER clause is an extension where the intent is to\nhave what the standard has; that is, a permanent record of who defined\nthe view. This is why the default DEFINER value is the account of the\nview creator.\n\nThe optional ALGORITHM clause is a MySQL extension to standard SQL. It\naffects how MySQL processes the view. ALGORITHM takes three values:\nMERGE, TEMPTABLE, or UNDEFINED. The default algorithm is UNDEFINED if\nno ALGORITHM clause is present. For more information, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/view-algorithms.html.\n\nSome views are updatable. That is, you can use them in statements such\nas UPDATE, DELETE, or INSERT to update the contents of the underlying\ntable. For a view to be updatable, there must be a one-to-one\nrelationship between the rows in the view and the rows in the\nunderlying table. There are also certain other constructs that make a\nview nonupdatable.\n\nThe WITH CHECK OPTION clause can be given for an updatable view to\nprevent inserts or updates to rows except those for which the WHERE\nclause in the select_statement is true.\n\nIn a WITH CHECK OPTION clause for an updatable view, the LOCAL and\nCASCADED keywords determine the scope of check testing when the view is\ndefined in terms of another view. The LOCAL keyword restricts the CHECK\nOPTION only to the view being defined. CASCADED causes the checks for\nunderlying views to be evaluated as well. When neither keyword is\ngiven, the default is CASCADED.\n\nFor more information about updatable views and the WITH CHECK OPTION\nclause, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/view-updatability.html.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/create-view.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/create-view.html'),(458,'TRIM',38,'Syntax:\nTRIM([{BOTH | LEADING | TRAILING} [remstr] FROM] str), TRIM([remstr\nFROM] str)\n\nReturns the string str with all remstr prefixes or suffixes removed.

You cannot drop a data file from a\ntablespace which is in use by any table; in other words, the data file\nmust be empty (no extents used). See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/mysql-cluster-disk-data-objects.\nhtml. In addition, any data file to be dropped must previously have\nbeen added to the tablespace with CREATE TABLESPACE or ALTER\nTABLESPACE.\n\nBoth ALTER TABLESPACE ...

This is a common situation\nwhen you use MySQL for logging and you also periodically run SELECT and\nUPDATE statements that take a long time to complete.\n\nWhen a client uses INSERT DELAYED, it gets an okay from the server at\nonce, and the row is queued to be inserted when the table is not in use\nby any other thread.\n\nAnother major benefit of using INSERT DELAYED is that inserts from many\nclients are bundled together and written in one block. This is much\nfaster than performing many separate inserts.\n\nNote that INSERT DELAYED is slower than a normal INSERT if the table is\nnot otherwise in use. There is also the additional overhead for the\nserver to handle a separate thread for each table for which there are\ndelayed rows. This means that you should use INSERT DELAYED only when\nyou are really sure that you need it.\n\nThe queued rows are held only in memory until they are inserted into\nthe table. This means that if you terminate mysqld forcibly (for\nexample, with kill -9) or if mysqld dies unexpectedly, any queued rows\nthat have not been written to disk are lost.\n\nThere are some constraints on the use of DELAYED:\n\no INSERT DELAYED works only with MyISAM, MEMORY, ARCHIVE, and BLACKHOLE\n  tables. For engines that do not support DELAYED, an error occurs.\n\no An error occurs for INSERT DELAYED if used with a table that has been\n  locked with LOCK TABLES because the insert must be handled by a\n  separate thread, not by the session that holds the lock.\n\no For MyISAM tables, if there are no free blocks in the middle of the\n  data file, concurrent SELECT and INSERT statements are supported.\n  Under these circumstances, you very seldom need to use INSERT DELAYED\n  with MyISAM.\n\no INSERT DELAYED should be used only for INSERT statements that specify\n  value lists. The server ignores DELAYED for INSERT ... SELECT or\n  INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE statements.\n\no Because the INSERT DELAYED statement returns immediately, before the\n  rows are inserted, you cannot use LAST_INSERT_ID() to get the\n  AUTO_INCREMENT value that the statement might generate.\n\no DELAYED rows are not visible to SELECT statements until they actually\n  have been inserted.\n\no Prior to MySQL 5.5.7, INSERT DELAYED was treated as a normal INSERT\n  if the statement inserted multiple rows, binary logging was enabled,\n  and the global logging format was statement-based (that is, whenever\n  binlog_format was set to STATEMENT). Beginning with MySQL 5.5.7,\n  INSERT DELAYED is always handled as a simple INSERT (that is, without\n  the DELAYED option) whenever the value of binlog_format is STATEMENT\n  or MIXED. (In the latter case, the statement no longer triggers a\n  switch to row-based logging, and so is logged using the\n  statement-based format.)\n\n  This does not apply when using row-based binary logging mode\n  (binlog_format set to ROW), in which INSERT DELAYED statements are\n  always executed using the DELAYED option as specified, and logged as\n  row-update events.\n\no DELAYED is ignored on slave replication servers, so that INSERT\n  DELAYED is treated as a normal INSERT on slaves. This is because\n  DELAYED could cause the slave to have different data than the master.\n\no Pending INSERT DELAYED statements are lost if a table is write locked\n  and ALTER TABLE is used to modify the table structure.\n\no INSERT DELAYED is not supported for views.\n\no INSERT DELAYED is not supported for partitioned tables.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/insert-delayed.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/insert-delayed.html'),(490,'SHOW PROFILE',27,'Syntax:\nSHOW PROFILE [type [, type] ... ]\n    [FOR QUERY n]\n    [LIMIT row_count [OFFSET offset]]\n\ntype:\n    ALL\n  | BLOCK IO\n  | CONTEXT SWITCHES\n  | CPU\n  | IPC\n  | MEMORY\n  | PAGE FAULTS\n  | SOURCE\n  | SWAPS\n\nThe SHOW PROFILE and SHOW PROFILES statements display profiling\ninformation that indicates resource usage for statements executed\nduring the course of the current session.\n\nProfiling is controlled by the profiling session variable, which has a\ndefault value of 0 (OFF).
