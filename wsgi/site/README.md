Worship Song Database
=====================

Rewriting my old website, found at [worshipdatabase.webs.com](http://worshipdatabase.webs.com). This new website will be powered through Django, but I have yet to find a free/cheap server. I'll figure it out later.

If you would like to run the website to see where my site is at, currently, you can download the files and use Django's `runserver` command. If you have not worked with Django before, download Django (`pip install django`), navigate to the directory containing these files, and run `python manage.py runserver`. Thanks for checking out my project!
